//! # `cibos-console` — the line-oriented Console seam
//!
//! A single trait, [`Console`], that decouples line-oriented applications (the
//! shell, the login gate, CLI tools) from *where* their I/O goes. The same
//! application code runs against:
//!
//! * a host console backed by `std` stdin/stdout (development), or a capture
//!   console for tests — both live in `platform-cli`;
//! * an on-kernel console backed by the `Log` and `ReadKey` syscalls — lives in
//!   the kernel-side `cibos-app` runtime.
//!
//! Keeping the trait here, in a tiny `no_std` crate, is what lets the *existing*
//! applications and the existing `login::run_login` run unchanged on the booted
//! kernel: they depend only on this trait, not on a particular (std) backend.
//! This is the seam the architecture always intended — see `platform-cli`'s own
//! note that "applications written against the `Console` trait do not change"
//! when the on-device console arrives.
